In order to send a request from the UI to the TMS we use a protocol called websockets.

Think of a websocket as a way of sending messages in 2 directions.

The TMS sends data to the UI which looks like this

{
    "time_boot_ms" : integer
    "roll" : float between -2pi and + 2pi,
    "pitch" : float between -2pi and + 2pi,
    "yaw" : float between -2pi and + 2pi
    // will need somebody to come up with a full list   
}

in CubeConnection.py, this is the function "fetch" (as it fetches data from the cubepilot and passes it on to the UI)


When you click a button in the UI, it calls its respective request function.

For instance, the flap UI page triggers the sendFlapRequest(flapAngle) function.
This sends a websocket to the TMS which looks like this:

{
    "flap":number
    // add more later
}

We're yet to figure out how the flap servo etc. will work with the cubepilot.
